## Where Am I Coming From?

So I'm a developer speaking and reading primarily English, living in Japan, and sometimes traveling to Hong Kong, or the United States, mainly for work reasons.  I work for a Japanese branch of a US company, where a vast majority of our infrastructure is located in the Unites States.

|                  | Me            | Organization             |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Country**      | Japan         | United States<br />Japan |
| **Language**     | English       | English                  |
| **Tech Vendors** | United States | United States<br />China |

So this is me, and the summary is that I personally, and the organization I work for, primarily interact with US Vendors in English.

## Web Browsers Do It Right

Inside of most modern web browsers, you have the option to choose what your language preferences are.  So for myself, I choose English,  but technically I could add German to the bottom of the list, since I do understand that as well.  Web sites, then have the option to check what my language preferences are, and offer me a site that adheres to what I'm telling them is best for me.
